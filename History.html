    <h1>Valley View Farm History</h1>
    <img src="/images/unnamed (2).jpg" id="cheese1" alt="Pete and Liz" title="Elizabeth and Peter Mulholland">
    <div>
        <p>Peter and Elizabeth Mulholland have been a producer of goat milk and processor of cheese in Topsfield since
            1998
            three years after they married and made the decision to live on the property with Elizabeth’s mother Mary
            Brown.
            The year before they had acquired two Nubian does from a retiring cheesemaker from Ipswich where Peter was
            from.
            They bred the two does and began experimenting with cheesemaking and researching the goat cheese dairy
            industry.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>Over twenty years later they have expanded the herd to forty milkers and have the only licensed farmstead
            cheese
            making facility in Essex County. Their current production is 5-6,000 pounds of cheese a year from 40 milking
            goats and a modest amount of cows’ milk cheeses from milk purchased from local cow dairy farms. Varieties
            include chevre, feta, soft-ripened and cave aged styles. The cheese is sold directly off the farm, to retail
            and
            restaurants mainly on the Northshore but also in Boston and southern New England.</p>

    <div>
        <p>Valley View Farm is located on a hilltop of the eastern end of a drumlin on the remaining acreage of the
            Benjamin Towne farm dating to the 1830s. The house was originally a Greek Revival farm house and barn with
            over
            200 acres associated with it and that descending from Topsfield original Towne family settlers. In 1903 the
            property was purchased by a Harry Niles from Lynn, a lawyer. He transformed the farmhouse into a stylish
            three-story gambrel Colonial Revival dwelling and moved it to higher ground on the property. Shortly after
            the
            barn was enlarged. The property was used as gentlemen’s farm or summer retreat and became known as Valley
            View
            for its views over Wenham valley. The property has been determined as eligible for the National Historic
            Register and is part of an inventory of historic farms and rural retreats recently completed for the
            Massachusetts Historic Commission. The property is on a locally designated Scenic Road.</p>
