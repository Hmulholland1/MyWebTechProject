    <h1> The Cheese </h1>
    <img src="/images/IMG_0788.jpg" id="cheese1" alt="cheese1" title="Goat cheese">
    <p>Depending on the style of cheese we are making, we cool the milk to 70 or 88 degrees. At this point, specific
        cultures are added depending on the style of cheese we are making. After the cultures have been added, we wait
        approximately 1 hour, gently stirring the curd, and slowly the cultures active and populating in the milk. After
        an hour, we add an enzyme called rennet, the amount again dependent upon cheese. The more rennet will cause the
        milk to coagulate faster. For our soft fresh style cheese, we may add only a few drops, whereas in a harder
        style we will add up to multiple teaspoons to help it coagulate quicker.</p>
    <p>In the soft goat cheese the cultures are converting the lactose into lactic acid and a little bit of rennet helps
        with coagulation, resulting a curd resembling soft yogurt after 18 hours. At this point we ladle the curd into
        cheese cloth to hang for two more days, allowing they whey to drain from the curds leaving us the soft cheese.
        Then we add salt and other ingredients like herbs, garlic, smoked jalapeno and candied ginger to create about 8
        varieties of the soft cheese also called chevre. The cheeses is put into a sausague press and a long tube of
        cheese is pressed out. It is then chilled in long logs to make it easier to cut and be packaged into retail
        sizes. We also will bulk package this cheese in five pound bags for restaurant use. </p>
        <img src="/images/IMG_0036.jpg" id="cheese2" alt="cheese2" title="Soft Goat cheese">
    <p>If we are making a hard style, more rennet is used to coagulate the milk in forty minutes versus 18 hours. This
        is also known as rennet coagulation versus lactic acid coagulation. After the forty minutes we use stainless
        steel cheese harps with vertical and horizontal wires to cut the curd, which is now firm like tofu into 3/8ths
        cubes. Over the next hour we heat the curds up from 88 to 102 degrees while stirring. This is called cooking the
        curds, allowing them to release whey and increases the lactic acid which helps in the aging process of the
        cheese. After the hour we remove all the whey from the vat and are left with about 80% of the volume of the milk
        in whey leaving us a curd pack of about ten inches. The curd is scooped out into plastic micro-perforated cheese
        moulds. One mould is stacked on top of another to give a light pressing allowing more whey to be extracted.
        After twelve hours, we removed the curd from the moulds and dry salt the outside of the cheese. After three or
        four days of drying, which includes flipping the cheese every other day, the cheeses are put in the cheese cave
        on ash boards and age for 12 months to two years. As the cheese ages and dries it gains sharpness. We sell this
        style in whole wheels to cheese shops and restaurants and cut into smaller sizes for retail shops.</p>
