    <h1>All about goat cheese making</h1>
    <p>This website will be all about the process of cheese making we do on my farm Valley View Cheese Farmstead.</p>
    <p>The objective of this website is to show the process of how we make cheese on our farm with pictures and videos
        along with formatted explanations of the processes. It will also contain more about the other aspects of the
        farm that are hidden. This site will be important to not just me but my family, if I do this well enough I could
        use it for the promotion of our farmstead.</p>
    <p>The audience of this is the general public that has an interest in farmsteading and cheese making but it also is
        important for other cheese makers as seeing how we do things could help others.</p>
    <p>
        As stated before, the website will contain photos and videos with descriptions of the processes and fun facts.
        It is a general information site with our family's farm as the example and showpiece.</p>
