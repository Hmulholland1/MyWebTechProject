        <h1> The Milking Process</h1>
        <img src="/images/DSC_2521.jpg" id="goat1" alt="goats1" title="Goats waiting for grain">
        <p>Dairy goats like cows, are milked twice a day about twelve hours apart to maximize their production. But
            unlike
            the typical cow dairy, the goats at Valley View Farm are bred seasonall (in October and November) to “kid”
            or
            have their babies in March and April. This is also called “freshening” the goat meaning to refresh their
            milk
            supply. Nubians typically have between 1 and four kids, though goats only have two nipples, called teats.
            Their
            mammary system is called an udder. At Valley View Farm each doe or dam (the female goat) is “hand bred” to a
            buck picked out for their genetic potential to improve the qualities of the next generation of milkers –
            what we
            call the does in milk. We keep four to six bucks, but sometimes, we artificially inseminate or A.I. a doe if
            we
            want to bring in extra special genetics of a long lost or superstar buck. Gestation is 150 days and we have
            cameras on the herd at kidding time to make sure we can see when they start to come into labor. We want to
            be
            with them as they kid to ensure safe delivery of the kids and the health of the mother. We also hand raise
            the
            kids by bottle, removing them immediately from their mother. Raising dairy offspring separately from their
            mother is common in the dairy world. This allows for health management of both milkers and offspring, means
            the
            kids will be gentle to human interaction, keeps the udders of the milkers clean and healthy and allows the
            kids
            to be sold to new owners early because they can bottle fed without having to wait for weaning age. This
            saves
            time and money and space for us. We keep or “retain” about 6-10 doe kids and 1 or 2 bucks each year and sell
            the
            rest.</p>

            <img src="/images/DSC_2531.jpg" id="goat2" alt="goats1" title="Milking Machine">
        <p>The female goats come into the milking parlor twice a day through a doorway from their pen and up a set of
            ramps
            to an elevated platform where they can eat their grain and be milked from behind with an automated bucket
            milking machine. Each Nubian will milk between a half a gallon and a gallon and half a day. Factors that
            influence production include age, parity (how many kids they have), genetics, feed, and health. We like to
            see
            an average of ¾ a gallon across the whole lactation season which is about 300 days. With 40 goats of various
            ages and factors, this averages about 6000 gallons of milk that is processed into cheese a year. Before
            putting
            the milking machine on the goat’s teats, the udder and teats are washed with a detergent, teats are immersed
            in
            an anti-germ “pre-dip”, dried and stripped. After they are milked out, another dip called a post dip is used
            on
            each teat to protect them from invading bacteria while the orifice is closing. Normally, the saliva of a
            baby
            goat suckling would accomplish this. Each goat only takes a few minutes to “milk out” but the whole process
            will
            take about an hour and half two times a day. The milk is poured through a strainer with a filter disc to
            capture
            any dirt or debris and into the bulk milk cooling tank which cools 103 degree Fahrenheit milk down to 38
            degrees
            very quickly, preventing the growth of bacteria which will lead to early spoilage of the milk and off
            flavors.
            The bulk milk cooling tank is in a room called the milk room, which is a separate room from the milking
            parlor
            and the cheese make room. This is according to the State of Massachusetts code for dairy farming and is a
            way to
            prevent contamination from the milking parlor on the raw milk and contamination of the finished product from
            the
            raw milk.</p>
