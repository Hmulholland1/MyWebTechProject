        <h1> The Pasteurization Process</h1>
    <img src="/images/IMG_1868.jpg" id="milk1" alt="milk1" title="Pasteurizing tank">
    <p>After 2-3 days of collecting milk, we will make a batch of cheese. The milk is transferred out of the tank and
        into the pasteurizing/cheese making vat. In our case this is a modified 100 gallon formerly steam heated
        pasteurizer dating to the 1950s. When we started our dairy, new small scale equipment was not available so we
        had to modify older equipment to our purposes. The 38 degree milk must be heated up to 145 degrees which is the
        lowest temperature for legal pasteurization and held for 30 minutes. In addition to killing off bacteria in the
        milk, we must also heat the air above the milk to 150 degrees to kill off harmful bacteria that might be in the
        air. Milk can also be pasteurized for a shorter amount of time at higher temperature, but cheese makers prefer
        to do it at the lower temperature for a longer time believing that it changes the milk less and gives a better
        curd to the cheese. There is a recording chart that records the rise in temperature, the 30 minutes of
        pasteurizing and the cool down as well as the air temperature. We chill the milk down by running 32 degree water
        through pasteurizer.</p>

    <p>Depending on the style of cheese we are making, we cool the milk to 70 or 88 degrees. At this point, specific
        cultures are added depending on the style of cheese we are making. After the cultures have been added, we wait
        approximately 1 hour, gently stirring the curd, and slowly the cultures active and populating in the milk. After
        an hour, we add an enzyme called rennet, the amount again dependent upon cheese. The more rennet will cause the
        milk to coagulate faster. For our soft fresh style cheese, we may add only a few drops, whereas in a harder
        style we will add up to multiple teaspoons to help it coagulate quicker.</p>
